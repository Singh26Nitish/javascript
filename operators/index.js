// Operators
// Operators are used to assign values, compare, perform arithematic operators and many more. There are different types of arithematic 
// operators in javascript. 

// Assignment operators
// An assignment operator assign value to it's left operand based on the value on it's right operand. example

let x = 10;
let y = 12;

// Here we assigned 10 to the x so if we check value of x it's 10.
console.log(x);

// Comparison operators
// A comparison operaator compare it's operands and returna logicat value based on wether the comparison is true, 
// the operanda can be strings, numerical, logic and ooject values.

// Equal (==) 
// It compares wether the operands are equal 
console.log(x == y);

// Equal (!=)
// It compares wether the operands are not equal  
console.log(x != y);

// Strict equal (===)
// It compares both value and type, like if we have one string and one numerical. exaple:
let a = 3;
let b = "3";

// here the value of both a and b are same but types are different. 
console.log(a===b);


// Greater than (>)	
// It compares one operand is greater then anther or not. exapmle: 
console.log(y > x);


// less than (>)
// It compares the operand is less then other or not. example:
console.log(z < y);

// Greater than or equal (>=) 
// It compares both that operands are equal or grater then others.

// less than or equal (<=) 
// It compares both that operands are equal or less then others.

// Arithmetic operators
// An arithmetic operator takes numerical values (either literals or variables) as their operands and returns a single numerical value.
// example: +,-,*,/

// Bitwise operators
// A bitwise operator treats their operands as a set of 32 bits (zeros and ones), rather than as decimal, hexadecimal, or octal numbers. 
// example: a & b, a | b

// Logical operators
// Logical operators are typically used with Boolean (logical) values; when they are, they return a Boolean value. example
// a && b, a || b
